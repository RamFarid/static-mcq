# 😍My first project at all😍
This is my first project 😄.
The only project that use `OOP` each question is instance of question class 

### What's the project idea?
It just an exam that display the result directly after the exam ended, whether you finish it by yourself or the time ended 

### Advantages
- Uses of OOP paradigm
- Nice animation
- Directly know your results
- Easy on eyes UI (**I made it**)

### Disadvantages
As I mentioned before this was my first project on my journey with learning a web I didn't have no knowledge with database, servers, dynamic contents, backend, blablabla... So:
- Hardcoded questions (Static)
- No security with answers
  - By open the file source with DevTools you can see all the answers 😀
- No clean code a bit 
  - As it was my first project my full focus was on make the task not to make it the best
